Differentiation Notes

1. Give each agent a bias amount for every feature/action.  The bias will be added to that agent's theta value.  This only applies if there is more than one agent in a group
	a. Allocate and create the array of bias values when creating the agents
	b. Add the bias amount to theta when storing the amount after doing the sharing calculations.
	c. The amount of possible bias will be calculated based on THETA_BIAS_MAX parameter and stored in _p.theta_bias_max
	d1. Possibility: make sure total bias for each feature/action sums to 0.0f so the average theta is not impacted.  *** This won't work because weights for calculating the groups average theta are not uniform by agent ***
	d2. Subtract the bias when calculating average shared theta's so group's average theta is not impacted by the bias.
	
	Bias is only important if it exceeds the difference between theta values for two actions in one state.
