Things to test and notes about the results
As new 'best' values are determined, the baseline should be re-run with
those values and other tests repeated off the new baseline.

Test the starting range for theta.
baseline is -1.0 to 1.0
next is 0.0 to 0.0
then try -1.0 to 0.0
and -.01 to 0.0

Note much difference when running baseline.  Use -1.0 to 0.0 for other testing.
